## Description
This real estate management platform enables users to create and manage multiple property listings. It features a public-facing landing page that showcases all available properties, with each listing having its own detailed and visually appealing page for maximum presentation impact.

Why I build it?
I developed this platform to solve a clear need in the real estate industry: agents require a centralized, accessible system to showcase their entire portfolio from any location and efficiently manage property assignments for their diverse clientele.

What problem does it solve?
This platform addresses the challenge of disconnected and non-visual real estate data management. Traditional methods like spreadsheets make it difficult to track performance and gain insights.

Our solution centralizes all property and client information into a single dashboard. Users can not only easily update property details but also instantly access visualized data through interactive charts and graphs. This transforms raw data into actionable business intelligence, helping agents track performance metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Full-Stack Property Management: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) property listings. Includes a preview mode to review listings before publishing them.

- Property Reservation System: A functionality for users to reserve properties, enabling the core business transaction of the platform.

- Interactive Dashboard: An admin panel featuring data visualizations (charts, graphs) to display key performance indicators and property statistics.

- Public Landing Page: A clean, responsive homepage designed to showcase all available properties to potential clients.
